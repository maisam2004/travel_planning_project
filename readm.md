## Backend of application

#### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the backend of our Flask TravelApp project! In this section, we'll delve into the inner workings of our backend architecture, exploring its crucial role in managing server-side operations, processing data, and interacting with the database.

The backend serves as the backbone of our application, handling various tasks such as user authentication, data retrieval and manipulation, and business logic implementation. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the application, providing the necessary infrastructure for delivering content to users and facilitating seamless interactions between the frontend and the database.

A well-designed backend is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of our application. It enables us to efficiently process user requests, handle complex business logic, and manage data persistence, ultimately contributing to a positive user experience.

In the following sections, we'll explore the technologies, database structure, and route explanations that comprise our backend architecture, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms that power our Flask TravelApp.but first lests see  file structure

<img src="./travel_planning/static/images/wireframes/file_structure.jpg" style="width: 40%; height: 20%;">

### **File Structure:**

**-Core application structure:**

* **run.py:** The main Flask application file that launches the server and routes requests to appropriate handlers.
* **routes.py:** Defines URL routing logic and logic for handling incoming requests. It renders templates, interacts with data models, and serves as the central entry point for application functionality.
* **models.py:** Defines data models that represent entities in your application. These models typically interact with a database using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
* **forms.py:** Defines forms for user input validation. Forms help ensure data integrity and provide a structured way to collect user input. WTForms is a common library used for form creation.
* **templates/**: Contains HTML templates that define the application's user interface. Flask renders these templates with dynamic content populated from data models and forms.

**-Application configuration:**

* **__init__.py:** An empty file or file containing initialization code for the package. In some cases, it might import core modules to establish the package structure.
* **env.py:** Defines sensitive configuration settings like security keys, database URLs, and mail service details. This file should **never** be committed to version control (e.g., GitHub) due to the sensitive nature of its contents.
* **.gitignore:** A file that specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control. This helps prevent sensitive information (like `env.py`) and unnecessary files (like `venv`) from being committed to repository.

**-Deployment:**

* **Procfile:** (Optional) A file used by deployment platforms like Heroku to specify the commands to run your application in a production environment.
* **Requirements.txt:** A file that lists the Python packages required by your application. This file ensures that the same dependencies are installed on different environments, promoting consistency and reproducibility.

**Additional :**

* **static/**: This directory is included in your response, but it's a common location to store static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files that are directly accessible to the web browser.
* **dump.sql**: This SQL dump file is used to replicate your database on Heroku Postgres.
* **Maintain consistent formatting:** Use consistent indentation and spacing to improve readability.

### 2. Technologies and Frameworks:

"**To ensure the proper functioning of this application, the following technologies must be imported within the routes.py file.**"

Here's an updated list of technologies and frameworks used in your Flask TravelApp project :

* Flask: A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
* Flask SQLAlchemy: A Flask extension that adds ORM support for SQLAlchemy, facilitating database interactions.
* Flask Login: A Flask extension for managing user authentication and session management.
* Flask Mail: A Flask extension for sending email messages.
* PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system used for data storage in the application.
* Werkzeug: A utility library for WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) applications, used in Flask for file handling and other tasks.
* Jinja2: A templating engine for Python, used in Flask for generating dynamic HTML content.
* Psycopg2: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python, used for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
* SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, used in conjunction with Flask SQLAlchemy for database operations.
* SMTPlib: A Python library for sending email messages via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
* Heroku: A cloud platform that hosts your Flask application and provides tools for deployment, scaling, and monitoring.

### Database Structure:

This application utilizes a PostgreSQL database for storing data. The database schema was designed to efficiently manage application data such as users, destinations, and travel plans.

To define the database structure, models were created using a Python framework (e.g., SQLAlchemy). These models represent the data entities captured by the application forms, ensuring consistent data storage and retrieval.

***Travel_planning DB***

The provided images (db_pic1.jpg and db_pic2.jpg) illustrate the relationships between the database tables.

<img src="./travel_planning/static/images/wireframes/db_pic1.jpg" style="width: 70%; height: 20%;">

<img src="./travel_planning/static/images/wireframes/db_pic2.jpg" style="width: 60%; height: 20%;">

To ensure the proper creation of database tables, I meticulously examined the forms utilized on each page of the application. Understanding the data input requirements of these forms was crucial for designing the database schema effectively.

To translate these form structures into database tables, I created two essential files: models.py and forms.py. The models.py file defined the database models corresponding to each form, specifying the fields and their data types. On the other hand, the forms.py file encapsulated the form structures themselves, facilitating data validation and user input handling.

This systematic approach ensured that the database tables accurately represented the data captured by the application forms, establishing a robust foundation for seamless data management and retrieval.

###### For the homepage,

    -route (/)

Here's the table specifically for the home route,

| Route (URL Pattern) | HTTP Method | Description                              | Page Interaction                                      | Database Table(s) | Related models.py Classes | Related forms.py Classes |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/` (Home)        | GET         | Displays the homepage                    | - Show "Travel Packages" section                      | `TravelPackage` | `TravelPackage`         | -                        |
| `/` (Home)        | POST        | Handles "Wished Holiday" form submission | - Process and store user's wished holiday preferences | `WishedHoliday` | `WishedHoliday`         | `WishedHolidayForm`    |

I've implemented a feature to display enticing deals to users. These deals are sourced from a dedicated table in the database called TravelPackage.

```
def home():
  
    travel_packages 			=    TravelPackage.query.all()
```

To achieve this, I created a database model named TravelPackage to represent each deal. This model is closely integrated with a form specifically designed for adding new deals, which is accessible through an admin-only page called ***add_travel_package.***

The add_travel_package page, although not visible to regular users, serves as a management interface for administrators to insert new deals into the TravelPackage table.

* modal part deals use these data as well

| `/add_travel_package` | GET         | Displays the "Add Travel Package" form       | - Renders the form to add a new travel package | None                                      | None                                      | `AddTravelPackageForm` |
| `/add_travel_package` | POST        | Handles "Add Travel Package" form submission | - Processes and stores new travel package data | `TravelPackage`, `TravelPackageImage` | `TravelPackage`, `TravelPackageImage` | `AddTravelPackageForm` |

**Explanation:**

* The table shows both GET and POST methods for the home route (`/`).
* The GET request:
  * Retrieves all `TravelPackage` objects from the database using `TravelPackage.query.all()`.
  * Renders the "home.html" template, passing the retrieved travel packages and an empty `WishedHolidayForm` to the template context.
* The POST request:
  * Validates the submitted `WishedHolidayForm` data.
  * Creates a new `WishedHoliday` object with data from the form, including user ID retrieved from `current_user` (ensure it's correct).
  * Adds the `WishedHoliday` object to the database session using `db.session.add(wished_holiday)`.
  * Commits the changes to the database using `db.session.commit()`.
  * Handles potential exceptions (e.g., database errors) using a `try-except` block:
    * On success, flashes a success message and redirects to the `wished_holiday` route (assuming it exists).
    * On error, logs the error, flashes an error message, and re-renders the `home.html` template with the form.

juse explain login_manager :

**`@login_manager.user_loader`:**

This decorator defines a function named `load_user` that acts as the user loader for Flask-Login. Its purpose is to retrieve a user object based on the provided user ID.

**Explanation:**

* The `@login_manager.user_loader` decorator associates the `load_user` function with the Flask-Login instance.
* The function takes a `user_id` argument representing the unique identifier of the user.
* It uses the `User.query.get(int(user_id))` expression to retrieve the user object from the database based on the provided ID (converted to an integer).
* This function is crucial for Flask-Login to manage user sessions and identify logged-in users.

> These routes demonstrate essential user authentication functionalities. The `load_user` function establishes a mechanism for Flask-Login to retrieve users, while the `/login` route handles login requests, validates credentials, and manages user sessions

**Explanation:**

* The table shows both GET and POST methods for the route.
* The GET request renders the "Reset Password Request" form for users to enter their email address.
* The POST request:
  * Validates the form data.
  * Checks if the email exists in the `User` table (using `User.query.filter_by(email=form.email.data).first()`)
  * If the email exists:
    * Generates a secure token for password resetting.
    * Saves the token in the user's `reset_password_token` attribute.
    * Creates an email message with HTML content (including a reset link) and sends it to the user's email address using Flask-Mail.
    * Flashes a success message if the email is sent successfully.
  * If the email doesn't exist, flashes an error message.
* The route redirects back to the login page (`url_for('login')`) in all cases.

**Additional Note:**

* Remember to configure Flask-Mail with your email server settings.

Table for `/reset_password_token/<token>` Route:

| Route (URL Pattern)                     | HTTP Method | Description                              | Page Interaction                               | Database Table(s)   | Related models.py Classes | Related forms.py Classes |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/reset_password_token/<token>`(GET)  | GET         | Displays the "Reset Password" form       | - Renders the form for entering a new password | `User`(potential) | `User`                  | `ResetPasswordForm`    |
| `/reset_password_token/<token>`(POST) | POST        | Handles "Reset Password" form submission | - Processes and updates the user's password    | `User`(potential) | `User`                  | `ResetPasswordForm`    |

**Explanation:**

* The table shows both GET and POST methods for the route.
* The `<token>` in the URL pattern represents a unique token associated with the password reset request.
* The GET request:
  * Retrieves the user object (potentially using the token) - Note: The example code uses `User.query.get(1)` which is not recommended for production due to bypassing token validation.
  * Renders the "Reset Password" form for entering the new password.
* The POST request:
  * Validates the form data.
  * Updates the user's password using `user.set_password(form.password.data)`, ensuring secure hashing (replace `bcrypt` with your chosen method).
  * Saves the changes to the database using `db.session.commit()`.
  * Flashes a success message and redirects to the login page.

**Important Notes:**

* The provided code snippet uses `User.query.get(1)` to retrieve the user, which is not secure and bypasses token validation. In a production environment, you should use the token to retrieve the associated user object and ensure it's valid before allowing password reset.

> This table and explanation provide a general overview of the route's functionality. Remember to adjust the details and implement proper security measures based on your specific implementation and user authentication requirements.
