        <h2>The Purpose of this Policy</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this policy, along with our Terms of Service, is to explain how we collect, use and protect your personal data across our applications and websites.

        <h2>Definition of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We define ‘personal data’, broadly, as any information pertaining to you as an identifiable individual. Your name, email address, contact details, IP address or device IDs are examples that satisfy this definition. We may also store other, less specific, information about how you use our service, or which country you are using our systems from. As we often work with suppliers who also receive your personal information (e.g. travel sites, agents, airlines, etc.) as part of the booking process, we will always provide links which allow you to check on their privacy policies and terms and conditions along with your booking.</p>

        <h2>How do we collect personal data?</h2>
        <p>As users visit our sites or use our apps, there is a myriad of of information collected and stored about their experience. There’s little point in collecting more than is needed, so we stick to the important things. Here are some examples of how we collect only what’s required.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>You give it to us voluntarily</h3>
        <p>Information you choose to give us might include personal data needed for you to book travel for yourself and others. This ranges from the dates and destination you choose in a search, to the basic stuff for making a booking with a Travel Supplier such as names and contact details. It can also include content like the reviews or photographs you upload to our services to share with other travellers. Most importantly, it’s always up to you whether or not you choose to give us this kind of information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>We generate or collect it automatically</h3>
        <p>We generate or collect some information from your computer or device automatically as you use our services. This includes stuff like your IP address, information about the device and browser you are using to access our services, the website URL you visited us from and the third party sites you visit when you click on links to exit the Wego site. It also includes details of the bookings you have made via Wego. We may also know your location from your mobile or your IP address. This helps us to improve your experience and make sure you receive the content that’s most relevant to you.</p>

        <h2>What are web beacons and pixels?</h2>
        <p>Web beacons or pixels are extremely small (often the size of 1 pixel, hence the name), transparent image files inside a web page or email. We use them to understand how you interact with Travel Supplier sites you have been redirected to. For example, we might use the beacon to confirm if you completed the booking with them, and what you booked. We also use beacons to gather information such as whether you’ve opened an email, so that we can determine if the content was of interest, and thereby improve the nature of communications with you.</p>

        <h2>What are tracking codes?</h2>
        <p>Tracking codes are snippets of code placed in the page to measure things like visits and interactions. We use tracking codes to find out more about how you interact with our websites and applications, advertising, and how you navigate TravelApp sites.</p>

        <h2>What are your choices and rights?</h2>
            <p>If you’ve got a Wego account, you can access, edit, download or delete the key personal data associated with your profile at any time by going to your Profile. From here you can also manage your subscription and marketing preferences. You also have rights in relation to the personal data we have about you, which we explain in more detail below. You can exercise these rights by getting in touch with us via your Profile page.</p>
            
            <p>You have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, machine readable format. In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement). Where we have asked for your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time. If you ask to withdraw your consent to Wego processing your data, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority. To the extent that you’re unable to satisfactorily exercise any of these rights via your Profile, you can do so by contacting our Data Protection Officer by post at Wego, 1 Harbourfront Place, #18-04, HarbourFront Tower One, Singapore 098633, or electronically via your Profile page. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority.</p>
